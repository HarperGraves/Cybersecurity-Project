We opened Tenable Nesus 
We went from the homepage to explore overview.
We went from the overview to the findings.
We were looking for highest risk of vulnerabilities.
Once we found one, we read through all the details and the description until we found a potential solution.
I read through this paper, 'DNS Cache Snooping' or 'Snooping the Cache for fun and profit' by Luis Grangeia.
What I got out of the paper is that it is a safer BIND configuration that I could apply or use.
I created a folder and saved it for later.
I decided that this is a good solution but it a may be a little over my head, so we will continue doing research until we a simpler solution or a better one.
I did some more research about the vulnerability and found a microsoft document about it. 
It recommends for the resolution 3 different options: 
- If the DNS server stays on a cooperate network, than you can leave it on, as long as no one outside can get into it.
- For DNS servers during recursion, don't allow access to the public for DNS recursion.
- Disable recursion.
We think out of the 3 solutions that the document gave me, I believe that the 3rd one makes the most sense to have because if anyone is not using it a certain time, than it should be turned off.
We think it could be a problem if someone is trying to get in and couldn't figure out what the problem if it was turned off. 
We would check with management that if many people are coming in for after hours work and see if they are using the internet. 
We think we should wait for a response from management about this DNS server solution.
We decided to check out the other two solutions and we chose the 2nd solution.
We chose this solution because it does make the most sense and we would use the firewall and anyone that could access it would be employees only.
We searched for the purpose of finding the possible solution for the 2nd solution. 
We searched for it and found a solution that was a watchguard community article. 
We found that the community article wasn't a solution for our case.
We searched more to try and find a better solution and we found a watchguard help center guide on configure firebox DNS settings.
We searched through the new guide and found nothing that would be helpful for our case.
We found another article that talks about DNSWatch which would be helpful in finishing the implementation of our solution.
We are recommending that you unlock the lock for the DNSWatch and switch the usuage enforcement to 'enfore on selected interfaces.' Than select all your interfaces.
We believe that doing this for a solution to the DNS server problem would be helpful in the company for our fellow employees in the company.
