PROCESS GUIDE ABOUT VULNERABILITY.
I opened Tenable Nesus 
I went from the homepage to explore overview.
I went from the overview to the findings.
I were looking for highest risk of vulnerabilities.
Once we found one, we read through all the details and the description until we found a potential solution.
I read through this paper, 'DNS Cache Snooping' or 'Snooping the Cache for fun and profit' by Luis Grangeia.
What I got out of the paper is that it is a safer BIND configuration that I could apply or use.
I created a folder and saved it for later.
I decided that this is a good solution but it a may be a little over my head, so we will continue doing research until we a simpler solution or a better one.
I did some more research about the vulnerability and found a microsoft document about it. 
It recommends for the resolution 3 different options: 
- If the DNS server stays on a cooperate network, than you can leave it on, as long as no one outside can get into it.
- For DNS servers during recursion, don't allow access to the public for DNS recursion.
- Disable recursion.
I think out of the 3 solutions that the document gave me, I believe that the 3rd one makes the most sense to have because if anyone is not using it a certain time, than it should be turned off.
I think it could be a problem if someone is trying to get in and couldn't figure out what the problem if it was turned off. 
I would check with management that if many people are coming in for after hours work and see if they are using the internet. 
I think we should wait for a response from management about this DNS server solution.
I decided to check out the other two solutions and we chose the 2nd solution.
I chose this solution because it does make the most sense and we would use the firewall and anyone that could access it would be employees only.
I searched for the purpose of finding the possible solution for the 2nd solution. 
I searched for it and found a solution that was a watchguard community article. 
I found that the community article wasn't a solution for our case.
I searched more to try and find a better solution and we found a watchguard help center guide on configure firebox DNS settings. 
I searched through the new guide and found nothing that would be helpful for our case.
I found another article that talks about DNSWatch which would be helpful in finishing the implementation of our solution.
I are recommending that you unlock the lock for the DNSWatch and switch the usuage enforcement to 'enfore on selected interfaces.' Than select all your interfaces.
I believe that doing this for a solution to the DNS server problem would be helpful in the company for our fellow employees in the company.
