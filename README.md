# Cybersecurity-Project

Description: This is a job shadow that I am doing for my school and I am doing this to learn more about tech/computer stuff. This project is about cybersecurity and what things that need to be fixed that I found. I used these resources below to figure out my answer towards cybersecurity and the problem with it. I was fixing the vulnerability by doing this research on these different resources to fix that vulnerability.
